# PostgreSQL-HW
Jupyter notebook folder contains jupyter notebook required for pulling data and creating plots using sqlalchemy. Please note that the password required for this notebook file has been redacted with asterisks as to not upload it to this GitHub repository.
The SQL folder contains 3 .sql files.  HWschema.sql was used to create the tables in PostgreSQL and HW Queries 2.sql was used to query the database and answer the required questions.  The QuickDBD-export(3).sql was exported after creating the ERD; however it would not run in PostgreSQL but it was only added as a reference.  
The Salaries Plot folder contains a plot of average salaries per title that was made in Jupyter notebooks.
The Screenshot folder contains a screenshot of the ERD used for this project along with a PDF report of the ERD.
The csv files folder contains the .csv files that were used to create the database as a courtesy and for convenience.
